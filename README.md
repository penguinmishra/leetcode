### Purpose
- I wanted a repo to add java solutions to the problems posted on leetcode. So, this is the one.

### Notes
- I have added to each java solution file a link to the actual problem statement.
- You can create a PR for review and if it works, I shall approve the PR and add it as a solution to the problem. :slightly_smiling_face:
