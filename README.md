### Purpose
- A repo to add java solutions to the problems posted on leetcode. So, this is the one.
- Below is the list which provides direct links to the respective problems.
- Additionally, each java solution file has a link to the actual problem statement.
- You can create a PR for review and if it works, I shall approve the PR and add it as a solution to the problem. :slightly_smiling_face:
